			  Hello friend. Hello friend? That's lame. 
			  Maybe I should give you a name. But that's a slippery 
			  slope, you're only in my head, we have to remember that. 
			  Shit, this actually happened, I'm talking to an imaginary 
			  person. What I'm about to tell you is top secret. 
			  A conspiracy bigger than all of us. There's a powerful 
			  group of people out there that are secretly running the 
			  world. I'm talking about the guys no one knows about, the 
			  ones that are invisible. The top 1% of the top 1%, the
			   guys that play God without permission. And now I think 
			   they're following me. <br/><br/>
